The first Programming language:
mnemonics were create to make programming faster and much easier for new comers to understand
programmers created assemblers to read aprogram created in an assembly language and converts it to machine code
Grace Hopper created A 0, created the first compiler 
John Backus made a programming system to make programs easier to write



Operating systems:
operating systems were made so that running computers would be more efficient
computers do batch processing
computers got so fast that they were constantly waiting for slower things like people gathering no programs
Atlas supervisor allowed for a single CPU to run multiple things by putting some code to sleep while working on other things 
to avoid memory loss programs were always allocated their own set of memory
